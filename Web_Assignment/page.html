    <h1>Welcome to Web Development</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages.
     It helps structure content on the internet by using tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, 
     tables, and forms. HTML tells the web browser how to display text and other content, but it does not handle styling or logic by itself.
     It works together with CSS for design and JavaScript for interactivity, making it the foundation of all websites.
